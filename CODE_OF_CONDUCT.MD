# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment,  
we as contributors and maintainers of the ITC AI Business Council repositories  
pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience  
for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity  
and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,  
or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Focusing on what is best for the community  
- Showing empathy toward other community members  

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassing, intimidating, or discriminatory comments or actions  
- Public or private harassment, insults, or name‑calling  
- Trolling or shaming any person  
- Publishing others’ private information (doxing)  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior  
- Enforcing the Code of Conduct fairly and consistently  
- Responding to reports of unacceptable behavior  
- Maintaining respect and confidentiality toward all parties  

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all ITC AI Business Council repositories,  
GitHub organization discussions, meetings, and public events organized by the Council.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting any council maintainer:

- **Email**: conduct@itc-aibc.org

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.  
Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code,  
editors, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct,  
and may temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
